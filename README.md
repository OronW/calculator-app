# CalculatorApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

It was Created by Oron Werner, using Angular 8 and WebStorm IDE.

The app calculates all numbers, using the four basic mathematical operations - add, subtract, multiply and divide.
It refuses to receive invalid expressions, such as starting an expression with an operation or trying to use more then one operation before the second number.

If more then one operation is selected - only the last one will be performed.

It's possible to continue calculation after a result had been showed. simply choose the next operation, and input another number.
If a number will be entered after a resuly is showen - the expression will be reseted.
